## Description
This is a POC application to demonstrate the use of the following technologies:

- Microservices architecture using ASP.NET Core
- Gateway pattern using YARP
- CQRS pattern using MediatR
- Domain Driven Design (DDD) principles
- Event Sourcing using EventStore
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- MongoDB for data storage
- Redis for caching
- RabbitMQ for messaging and async communication
- Serilog for logging
- Swagger for API documentation
- Service Discovery using Consul
- Health Checks for monitoring
and more...

## Project Status
The project is in the early stages of development. The following features are implemented:
- API Gateway using YARP
	- Upfront JWT authentication
	- Routing
	- Rate Limiting
- Multiple microservices for
	- *Identity Service* - User Registration, Authentication, and Authorization
	- *Data Service* - Read and Write operations to Postgres

## Next Steps
- Implement the following features:
	- Kubernetes for orchestration
	- MongoDB with EF Core for data storage
	- Redis for distibuted caching
	- RabbitMQ for messaging and async communication
	- GRPC for inter-service communication
	- Serilog for logging
	- Service Discovery using Consul
	- Health Checks for monitoring
	- Request Aggregation for multiple microservices
and more to come...
